# lottery

**lottery** is a blockchain application built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint and generated with [Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport).

## Get started

```
starport serve
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, initializes and runs the application.

** Do not `npm install` in Vue
This application normally runs on gitpod, not local. We already changed many files in vue/node_modules.
